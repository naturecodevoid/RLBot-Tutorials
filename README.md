# RLBot-Tutorials
All the scripts from the RLBot tutorial series by Blocks_ (@TheBlocks) on https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueBots/.
Scripts are being updated, fixed, and maintained by @naturecodevoid

Changelog:

- Add `import`s for rlbot
- Change `Agent` to `PythonExample(BaseAgent)` so you can copy 'n paste into `RLBot/RLBotPythonExample/python_example/python_example.py`
- Change `distance` function to global on part 4 + part 5
- Add a controller for parts missing one and assigning it with `self.controllerPart`
